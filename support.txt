Hi support.

In testing some automation with the PagerDuty API I may have inadvertently deleted some services from the rea-cobra pagerduty account.

The API key is "PagerDuty config-as-code testing" ••••••••••••••••s2KE

The test I was running was supposed to create a service called "GDE Test service", see if the service could be found, and delete it. I've discovered that I was accidentally finding all services and deleting the first one in the list.

I ran this and some other tests a number of times in the last 24 hours.

Can you please tell me which, if any services, apart from ones called "GDE Test service", have been deleted using the above API key in the last 24 hours?

Is it possible to undelete these?

Thanks,
Luke
